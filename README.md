# Lab - ProjectONE

This is my lab project where I write code and test my **Elixir** skills.

# How to run

To run the entire project and compile all modules, use:

`iex -S mix`

### Running as scripts

To run a file as a script, use in your **terminal**. Don't forget to call the module in the file.  

`elixir "lib/math.ex"`

### Compile IEx

To run a file in **IEx**, use:

`c("lib/math.ex")`

### CodeRunner Extension

To make development faster, I prefer using the **CodeRunner** extension in VS Code. Just install, configure it, and run files with a **hotkey**.
